=====================  =========================================================================

All columns are Sqlite text fields.

The column *newresponses* is updated by the backend whenever a new user response is processed, and is reset to zero whenever the :obj:`rundyfi.py` runs. This is how the backend knows when :obj:`rundyfi.py` should be triggered.

The column *orig_id* is initially the same as *eventid*. This allows the
first event ID to be archived in case the event ID is manually changed.

The column *invisible* is set to true when an event is no longer valid, and DYFI products are no longer applicable. Examples are bogus, duplicate, or non-authoritative events. These events will not be exported, and responses will not be automatically associated to them. (They may still be run manually.)

.. note::

    Obsolete columns are for compatibility with DYFI3 only. They will be removed in a future release.

=====================  =========================================================================

All columns are Sqlite text fields unless indicated otherwise.

The column *orig_id* is initially the same as *eventid*. For responses that were not originally attached to an event ("unassociated entries"), both fields would have the value "unknown". This allows the original data to be archived in case the this entry is associated or manually updated.

The column *suspect* is set automatically by the :py:obj:`Entry` module when the entry is suspected to be bogus or an outlier. The operator may also manually flag entries this way.

The column *time_now* is set by the DYFI Felt Report submit function. This is the time used for associating entries.

The column *usertime* is filled in by the user. It is not automatically parsed; it is for the operator's information only.

The columns *latitude* and *longitude* are automatically filled in by the geocoding function of they DYFI Felt Report.

The column *confidence* is an estimate from the geocoding function of the precision of the latitude and longitude output. See `Geocoding` for details.

The column *user_cdi* is the value computed by the form the user's intensity (only), with no aggregation. It is a quick way to look for outlier entries, but it is not used in DYFI computation.

.. note::

    Obsolete columns are for compatibility with DYFI3 only. They will be removed in a future release.


UTM-based Aggregation
---------------------


DYFI products
-------------------------

The DYFI 'signature product' is no longer a static image but a GeoJSON file. This file contains the aggregated data as GeoJSON Features with coordinates for plotting and corresponding intensities (see the :obj:`Product Guide`).

The USGS Web Pages use the `Leaflet` rendering engine to display the maps, along with a suitable basemap. Users may use other rendering engines, such as `OpenLayers`, or a GIS application.

For the creation of static images, see the :doc:`Implementation Guide <Creation of static images>`.
