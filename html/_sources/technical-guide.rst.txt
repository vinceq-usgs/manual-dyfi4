=====================  =========================================================================

All columns are Sqlite text fields.

* *newresponses* is updated by the backend whenever a new user response is processed, and is reset to zero whenever the :obj:`rundyfi.py` runs. This is how the backend knows when :obj:`rundyfi.py` should be triggered.

* *orig_id* is initially the same as *eventid*. This allows the
first event ID to be archived in case the event ID is manually changed.

* *invisible* is set to true when an event is no longer valid, and DYFI products are no longer applicable. Examples are bogus, duplicate, or non-authoritative events. These events will not be exported, and responses will not be automatically associated to them. (They may still be run manually.)

.. note::

    Obsolete columns are for compatibility with DYFI3 only. They will be removed in a future release.

=====================  =========================================================================

All columns are Sqlite text fields unless indicated otherwise.

* *orig_id* is initially copied from *eventid*. For responses that were not originally attached to an event ("unassociated entries"), both fields would have the value "unknown". When this entry is associated to an event or updated to a different ID, this field will show the original value.

* *suspect* is set automatically by the :py:obj:`Entry` module when the entry is suspected to be bogus or an outlier. The operator may also manually flag entries this way.

* *time_now* is set by the DYFI Felt Report submit function. This is the time used for associating entries.

* *usertime* is filled in by the user. It is not automatically parsed; it is for the operator's information only.

* *latitude* and *longitude* are automatically filled in by the geocoding function of they DYFI Felt Report.

* *confidence* is an estimate from the geocoding function of the precision of the latitude and longitude output. See `Geocoding` for details.

* *user_cdi* is the value computed by the form the user's intensity (only), with no aggregation. It is a quick way to look for outlier entries, but it is not used in DYFI computation.

.. note::

    Obsolete columns are for compatibility with DYFI3 only. They will be removed in a future release.


DYFI products
-------------------------

The DYFI 'signature product' is no longer a static image but a GeoJSON file. This file contains the aggregated data as GeoJSON Features with coordinates for plotting and the corresponding intensities for each area (see the :obj:`Product Guide`).

The USGS Web Pages use the `Leaflet` rendering engine to display the maps, along with a suitable basemap. Users may use other rendering engines, such as `OpenLayers`, or a GIS application.

For the creation of static images, see the :doc:`Implementation Guide <Creation of static images>`.
